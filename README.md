I never had a chance to work with python, so I decided to start by creating a dice simulator that would be used with Dungeon and Dragons to help me learn the basics. 

The reason for this project is rather basic. My roommates in college have enjoyed playing the game, but there were times when disputes on rolls would come up or a set of dice would be misplaced. So creating this program is to help everyone feel that rolls are fair and if a specific di is lost, then a basic program may be used as well.
